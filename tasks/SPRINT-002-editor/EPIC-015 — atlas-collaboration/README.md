# Atlas Collaboration

Atlas Collaboration provides the provider-independent collaboration layer for the Atlas Editor ecosystem.

The package defines reusable collaboration abstractions that enable collaborative editing independently from networking protocols, synchronization algorithms, rendering engines, storage providers, and collaboration vendors.

# Design Principles

- Provider Independent
- Transport Agnostic
- Renderer Agnostic
- Storage Agnostic
- Synchronization Agnostic
- Extensible
- Modular
- Open for Extension
- Strongly Typed

---

# Out of Scope

- WebSocket implementation
- WebRTC implementation
- CRDT implementation
- Operational Transform implementation
- Database implementation
- Rendering implementation
- UI implementation

---

# Future Integrations

The collaboration abstractions are designed to integrate with future implementations including:

- WebSocket providers
- WebRTC providers
- CRDT engines
- Operational Transform engines
- Cloud collaboration services
- Enterprise collaboration platforms

without requiring changes to the Atlas Collaboration public API.
